  Presetting a factor      1.000 between actual scf density residual
  and density convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho below which sc_init_iter
  takes no effect.
 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.
 * The run will proceed with a reasonable default guess, but please check whether.
 * the s.c.f. cycles seem to take too much or too little time.
  Calculation of forces was not defined in control.in. No forces will be calculated.
  Geometry relaxation not requested: no relaxation will be performed.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.100000E-05 .

  | At each grid point, the set of atoms used to build the partition table is smoothly restricted to

  Partitioning for Hartree potential was not defined. Using partition_type for integrals.
  | Adjusted default value of keyword multip_moments_threshold to:       0.10000000E-11

  Using packed matrix style: index .
  Defaulting to use time-reversal symmetry for k-point grid.
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.
  Set 'collect_eigenvectors' to be '.true.' for all serial calculations. This is mandatory.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -15802.657883026 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -15802.657883026 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -12.560897894 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
